# Hi I am Ivan!

I develop applications and websites. I'm experienced in Flutter, Nuxt.js, Vue, Node.js, and JavaScript. Also I'm skilled in Tailwind CSS (beyondspacenews.com is build with it).

In hardware development, I work with ESP32 and Arduino for ESP projects for integrated IoT solutions.

I am also familiar with cloud-based services like Firebase and Appwrite.

### About me
Hailing from Croatia, my passion lies in exploring the realms of electricity, electronics, and programming. I find joy in tinkering with these domains, fostering a deep love for innovation. Alongside my tech pursuits, I harbor a fondness for travel and savoring diverse cuisines. While my heart belongs to cats as ideal companions, I remain open to other potential pets.

My perspective leans towards the positive side of things, embracing optimism as a guiding principle. Being a self-proclaimed tech enthusiast, I eagerly anticipate the endless possibilities that the future holds, especially in the realm of electric cars and mobility.
