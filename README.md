My name is Ivan but most know me by my discord username: **Sirius#3615** I am from Croatia.
Anyways I am a little developer online, I really like space and have a Discord server about it called [Beyond Earth ](https://discord.gg/QHKnU2pR). 

## I have made:

- a custom discord bot for my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QHKnU2pR) Its code is private and it will stay like that. Why? Because its one of its kind and pretty powerfull and mainly I don't wanna see someone make an exsact copy of it.

- Website using HTML/CSS and pure JavaScript. you can find it [here!](http://beyond-gg.glitch.me/)

- **Astronomy Events API** - Thats a Simple REST API to get the lates Astro events like: Meteor showers, moon phases, planet aligments... More info about it [here.](https://astronomy-events-api.glitch.me/)

Discord is my main form of comunication and I spend most of my time on it, so if you have some questions feel free to DM me.
